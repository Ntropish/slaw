# Slaw

Slaw is currently the beginnings of a coleslaw themed midi editor. The intent is to continue developing slaw into a full-fledged open source, cross platform DAW.

Install by cloning the repository and running `yarn` or `npm install` in the root directory.

No production build process is currently available but slaw can be used in development mode with `yarn start`.

_Note: I haven't verified that all dependencies are included in the `package.json`. I might accidentally be relying on some globally available packages. Be prepared to diagnose manually add some packages if this is the case._
